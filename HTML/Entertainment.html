                <p>The Columbus Blue Jackets is one of our hockey teams. They rank number 8th in 
                the metropolitan. The Blue Jackets have a win-loss record of 27 to 43. It's not the best
                but given time the Blue Jackets could go huge in the state, or even the nation. Columbus has been
                producing various teams but the BJ's have a really good chance of doing something great. So maybe stop 
                by and watch a couple games.</p>
