        <p>This is a list of Columbus's different modes of transportation.<br> 
        There aren't to many but there are also different types of modes like Ubers.<br>
        The Urber foundation varies depending on the state. Some states have you pay by the mile<br>
        others pay by the minute. These are ways to travel around Columbus if you don't have your own car.<br>
        <br>
        CoGo Bikeshares: How CoGo Bikeshares works is pretty simple. You download<br>
        the app that is prompted. When you find one of the bikes just scan the QR code that is<br>
        attached to the bike by using the app's QR code scanner. You will then be able to cruise around the city.<br>
        When you finish riding around you can go to a CoGo docking station. Once the lights turn green your good to dock.<br>
        <br>
        Central Ohio Bikeways: This way of transportation is also very simple,<br>
        There are over 230 miles of different trails that connects Ohio. You can go on these<br> 
        trails by Bike, Scooter, Skateboard, and even running or walking. This is a lot more easy because<br>
        this mode of transportation involves your own speed and less money. You don't always have to rush as if someone<br>
        is taking you because you can freely move at your own speed. So why not give it a shot.<br>
        <br>
        Cota Bus Services: To ride a Cota bus you want to download the transit app.<br>
        With this downloaded you can plan your next trip and find the closest bus station in<br>
        your area. You can also check the prices and different destinations you could travel to. After<br>
        that you should make sure to get to a bus station at least 5 minutes early. When the bus arrives you<br>
        should make sure that the bus has the right destination on the top of the windsheild. If that is the case then<br>
        you will go ahead and board the Cota bus. You will pay uppon boarding. Then enjoy your ride and make sure to<br>
        get off at the right destination.</p>
